      <p> It all really started in 2016, when one of my friends got a Nissan Silvia. He invited me to several events, which got me really hooked on car events.
        <br>
        <br>
        I started visiting car related events more often, private meets, JapFest, Historic Grand Prix, Blancpain, NÃ¼rburgring, Spa Francorchamps and many more, 
        not just only events related to Japanese cars. However CARZOKU only really focusses on the Japanese cars.
